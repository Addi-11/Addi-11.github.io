            An AI simulation crafted to dominate in Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS). Sparked by inspiration from a Kaggle competition, this project aspires to create an RPS-playing agent capable of consistently outwitting humans. The model's intelligence is harnessed through Q-learning, a value-based learning algorithm. Guided by the Bellman equation, the Q table is a masterpiece, intricately filled based on the principles of Markov Decision Process (MDP). Join the simulation where algorithms become champions in the timeless game of RPS.
